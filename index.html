                    Being an advocate it was always taught justice has to be
                    rendered to poor and needy, I being a women I wanted to work
                    for women and on their problems. Women are said they are
                    empowered and they are taking position/ designation from
                    politics to corporate but I always felt it is only for few
                    women and the rest of the women are still under clutches of
                    social menace like Dowry, Dowry death, Prostitution, Child
                    marriage, female infanticide, rape, molestation, no proper
                    education, no equal rights provided as compared to male.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since various NGO is working on issues of Sex worker, Human
                    Trafficking, helping / assisting rape victim and also
                    working on various other social cause I thought of taking
                    different social Cause which was untouched. That was
                    <strong>
                      “DOWRY ISSUE”
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to me once the women get married and if husband
                    demand dowry then the NGO / Judiciary comes to rescue women,
                    but there is
                    <strong>
                      one period in women life
                    </strong>
                    where dowry is demanded highhandedly by in-law and girl
                    parents/ relative has to succumb to dowry demand just
                    because the girl has to get married. India has lot of case
                    pending in court where women has been killed just because
                    they were not able to meet dowry demand. And sometime parent
                    lose their entire life time earning just to get one girl
                    child married by paying dowry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In India because of Dowry, female feticide also increased by
                    time. Because once girl child is born parents of a girl
                    child feel burdened hence they kill girl child by aborting
                    or by any other mean and even if girl child is born she is
                    not treated at par with boy child.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However to fight this menace study was done as to why dowry
                    has increased in India and what are the steps taken by
                    government to stop this social menace called dowry. After
                    the thorough study it was realized that though Government
                    enacted a law called
                    <strong>
                      “DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT” 1961
                    </strong>
                    and it is not been implement in its spirit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Dowry Prohibition Act as per section 8(b) the State
                    Government has to appoint Dowry Prohibition officer at
                    required. And the Dowry Prohibition Officer can be appointed
                    at District Level, Taluka Level, etc. However the state
                    government till 2013 not appointed single Dowry Prohibition
                    officer, and even after the Honorable High Court passed an
                    Order to appoint the Dowry Prohibition officer till date the
                    government never initiated action to appoint Dowry
                    Prohibition Officer, and if the government would have
                    implemented this Act and Dowry Prohibition Officer would
                    have taken an action strictly as per the Dowry Prohibition
                    Act, today Indian women would have attained the epitome in
                    their personal and professional life. And while researching
                    on the Dowry it was realized that the Marriage broker,
                    online matrimonial website, Matrimonial Coloumn in newspaper
                    are also the responsible for the increasing demand in DOWRY.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Hence the petition was filed in the Bombay High Court
                    bearing No- 52 of 2013. I filed this petition as Petitioner
                    in Person and prayed as followed:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Strict implementation of Dowry Prohibition Act Petition was
                    filed to implement Dowry Prohibition Act strictly and to
                    take action against the people who violate the provision of
                    Dowry Prohibition Act.

                  <p>
                    In our country the Marriage bureau is one of the reason for
                    the increase in the dowry demand and Marriage bureau was
                    operating business without any registration. Marriage broker
                    increased the dowry demand in their market so that there is
                    a hike in their commission. With a passage of time, poor and
                    educated women were not able to get married.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because the marriage broker/marriage bureau were controlling
                    the destiny of young men and women and they became the
                    decision maker as to who has to marry whom. Since the
                    Marriage Bureau was doing business without registration
                    there was no control in the Marriage Bureau by the
                    Government.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since this point was argued in the Court the Honorable
                    Bombay High Court passed an Order that the Marriage Bureau
                    has to be registered under the Maharashtra Regulation of
                    <strong>Marriage Bureaus</strong> and
                    <strong>Registration of Marriages Act, 1998 </strong> .
                    Prior to the 2013 only 15-20 marriage bureau was registered
                    but after the High Court passed an Order for registration of
                    Marriage Bureau more than 600 marriage bureau got registered
                    by 2017.

                    bothering about the public life or the people who is joining

                  <p>
                    The people/members of the online matrimonial website was
                    lured, deceived and got cheated due to the Fake information
                    available in the online Matrimonial Websites. And in the
                    argument before the Court it is submitted that people are
                    getting cheated due to fake ID, fake photos, salary slip and
                    fake qualification and there is no control to get hold of
                    offender the poor victim who register their profiles with
                    the hope to get a rightful partner sometime get cheated and
                    loose their money and life. And it was also proved in the
                    Court as to how matrimonial website is participating in
                    dowry exchange between members who wants to get married to
                    each other. And court passed necessary order to regularize
                    matrimonial Website. As on 2017, 2018 matrimonial website
                    regularized their website and as on today the member has to
                    upload marksheet, salary slip and other relevant document to
                    prove their authencity to register their profile.

                    the soil cover of the trees that grow here has made the soil
